# tutle-animated-pencil-sketch

## This is the python code to make an animation of pencil sketch drawing from any given png source file using python cv2 and turtle.
### This is just a fun project, I used to create a sketch of Lord Shiva. But this may be useful to people in field of social media promotions or animations.
